## 📌 Introduction

Smart Gym is a modern operations hub for gyms and fitness studios. It streamlines daily workflows for staff and members, centralizing membership management, class scheduling and enrollment, cafe purchasing, messaging, and analytics. The app also includes an AI member assistant powered by Vercel AI SDK with Gemini, plus optional voice responses via ElevenLabs.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The application is built with a modular Next.js (App Router) architecture. UI is rendered with React, shadcn/ui, and Tailwind CSS. Server-side functionality is implemented via Next.js Route Handlers under `app/api`, integrating with Supabase for data and auth, Stripe for payments, and AI services for chat and optional voice.

| **Voice AI**       | ElevenLabs for text-to-speech responses in the client where voice is enabled.                                                    |
| **Payments**       | Stripe for cafe purchases and invoicing flows.                                                                                   |

## 📝 Commitlint Configuration

This project uses [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) to enforce consistent commit message conventions. The configuration extends the conventional commit standards with custom rules.

### Configuration File

The commitlint configuration is defined in `.commitlintrc.json`:

```json
{
  "extends": ["@commitlint/config-conventional"],
  "rules": {
    "type-enum": [2, "always", ["feat", "fix", "chore", "docs", "style", "refactor", "revert", "build", "ci"]],
    "header-max-length": [2, "always", 120],
    "body-max-line-length": [2, "always", 200],
    "footer-max-line-length": [2, "always", 200],
    "subject-case": [0, "never", "sentence-case"]
  }
}
```

### Allowed Commit Types

| Type       | Description                                                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | New feature                                                   |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                                                       |
| `chore`    | Changes to build process or auxiliary tools                   |
| `docs`     | Documentation only changes                                    |
| `style`    | Changes that do not affect the meaning of code                |
| `refactor` | A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature     |
| `revert`   | Reverts a previous commit                                     |
| `build`    | Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies |
| `ci`       | Changes to CI configuration files and scripts                 |

### Example Commit Messages

```bash

## 💻 Jira/Git Workflow

### Choose a Jira ticket

- In Jira, find a ticket to work on.
- Assign it to yourself and mark it as 'In Progress'.

### Create a branch from JIRA

- Use the JIRA interface to create a branch directly from the ticket. This will generate a branch name based on the ticket number and description.
- Follow the prompts to select the repository and branch source (usually `master`).
- Once the branch is created, copy the branch name.

### Local work

- Fetch the branch you created in Jira from the remote repository:

  ```bash
  git fetch origin [BRANCH-NAME]
  ```

- Check out the new branch:

  ```bash
  git checkout -b [BRANCH-NAME] origin/[BRANCH-NAME]
  ```

- Make your changes and then stage them. All commit messages must follow the project commitlint rules (see [Commitlint Configuration](#-commitlint-configuration) section above):
  - Start with one of the allowed commit types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `revert`, `build` or `ci`
  - Keep the header under 120 characters
  - The Jira ticket number should be at the end in parentheses

  Example commit commands:

  ```bash
  git commit -m "feat: add new button to dashboard (PROJ-123)"
  ```

  ```bash
  git commit -m "fix: resolve user fetch bug (PROJ-123)"
  ```

  ```bash
  git commit -m "chore: update dependencies (PROJ-123)"
  ```

### Push to GitHub and make a pull request

- Sync the remote repo with your local repo and your new branch:

  ```bash
  git push origin [TICKET-NUMBER]
  ```

- Under [GITHUB_REPO_URL/branches] you should find the branch you just pushed. Click on it.
- Click "Compare & pull request".
- Make sure base is set to master at the top.
- Adjust the title as needed and add a description.
- Add reviewers (2) by clicking the gear.
- Click "Create pull request".
- Once the PR is approved, the assignee (you) should complete the pull request by merging to master and delete the branch.
- Go back to Jira and change ticket status to done.

## 🎨 Design System

In order to use the in-line color schema within any front-end component, under `className`, use one of the following color configuration names:

- `primary-[color]`
- `secondary-[color]`
- `accent-[color]`
- `neutral-[color]`
- `[additional-color-names]`

These can be applied to background colors, text colors and border colors using [CSS framework]'s utility classes.

### Example Usage

#### Background Color

```jsx
<div className='bg-primary-[color] p-4'>This div has a primary [color] background.</div>
```
